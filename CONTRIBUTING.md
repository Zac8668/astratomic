## Contributor License Compromise

Independent contributions (i.e. individual pull requests) from anyone other than 'Isaac Turci @Zac8668' are dual-licensed as [Polyform NonCommercial](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0/) (granted to Spicy Lobster & Isaac Turci as the _licensor_) and [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), meaning all independent contributors retain ownership of their own contributions, albeit non-exclusively.

In other words, your contributions belong equally to the Astratomic project as they do to you.
