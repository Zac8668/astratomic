# Astratomic

Astratomic is a 2D survival game that draws inspiration from the likes of Noita and Starbound.
Powered by a similar engine as Noita, made from scratch with Rust.

## Current State and Goals

Right now the game is in a super early stage, but we aim to achieve a fun chaotic game with lots of procedural generation, infinite planets, the amazing noita engine, and much more.
